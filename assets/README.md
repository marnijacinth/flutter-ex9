Please save the recipe image you attached to the project in this location as:

assets/images/pasta.jpg

Steps:
1. Create the folder `assets/images/` (already created).
2. Save the provided image file into `assets/images/` and name it `pasta.jpg`.
3. Run `flutter pub get` from the project root.
4. Run the app with `flutter run`.

If you want me to add a placeholder image file automatically so the analyzer stops reporting a missing asset, tell me and I will create a small placeholder (note: it won't be the real photo).
